1. Retrieve statistics by day: Calculate the total number of events, views, clicks, unique ads, and unique campaigns per day.

2. Investigate the spike on 2019-04-05: Determine which events experienced an increase. 
Did this increase occur across all ads or only specific ones?

3. Find the top 10 ads by CTR (Click-Through Rate) of all time. CTR is the ratio of clicks to views. 
Is there a difference between the average and median CTR of the ads in our data?

4. It seems that there is a bug in our logs where ads have clicks but no views. 
How many ads are affected by this issue, and are there any patterns? Does this problem occur across all platforms?

5. What is the 95th percentile CTR for all ads on 2019-04-04?

6. For the financial report, we need to calculate our earnings per day. On which day did we earn the most? 
And the least? 
We charge customers for CPC (Cost Per Click) ads when a click occurs, and for CPM (Cost Per Mille) ads, 
we charge for each view at a rate of 200 rubles per 1000 views.

7. Which platform is the most popular for advertising placement? 
What percentage of views does each platform account for (based on the "platform" column)?

8. Are there any ads where the click occurred before the view?
